                        Pampanga, established on December 11, 1571, by Spanish authorities, 
                        derives its name from the native Kapampangan words “pangpang ilog,” 
                        meaning “riverside,” reflecting the early Malayan settlements along 
                        the Rio Grande de la Pampanga. The province's strategic location and 
                        fertile lands contributed to its prominence during the Spanish colonial period.

                    <p class="mt-2">
                        In the 17th century, Pampanga's skilled workers were in demand beyond the 
                        Philippines. Notably, the Dutch recruited Kapampangan men as mercenaries for 
                        the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army, where they were known as Papangers. 
                        Their legacy persists in North Jakarta, Indonesia, particularly in the small 
                        community of Kampung Tugu.

                        Throughout its history, Pampanga underwent several territorial changes. 
                        In 1860, northern towns such as Bamban, Capas, Concepcion, Victoria, Tarlac, 
                        Mabalacat, Magalang, Porac, and Floridablanca were separated to form the 
                        Comandancia Militar de Tarlac. By 1873, some towns were returned to Pampanga, 
                        while others became part of the newly created Province of Tarlac.

                    <p class="mt-2">
                        Today, Pampanga is renowned for its rich cultural heritage, particularly its 
                        culinary traditions, earning it the title of the "Culinary Capital of the Philippines." 
                        The province's history of gallant men and skilled women in culinary arts continues to 
                        influence its vibrant culture.
